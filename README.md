# SearchReminder
An Android app that I created as the result of an assignment for a programming course at WelTec. When not connected to the internet, it allows the user to set a reminder to search a given query on a given search engine. Once the user is back online, the app sends notifications which, when tapped, leads directly to the requested search results on the phones default browser.
